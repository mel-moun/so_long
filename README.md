## Overview üìù

`so_long` is a 2D puzzle game created in C, designed to test your skills in graphics programming and game design. The goal of the game is to navigate through a maze, collecting items and solving challenges, while avoiding obstacles and ensuring that the player can reach the exit. This project focuses on the use of the **MiniLibX** library to create the graphical user interface and manipulate images, as well as applying game logic to create an interactive and fun experience.

The game includes elements such as movement, collisions, and environment interactions.

## Features üåü

- **Player Movement**: The player can move up, down, left, and right through the maze.
- **Objective Collection**: The player must collect specific items (e.g., coins) to unlock the exit.
- **Exit Handling**: After collecting all items, the player can exit the maze.
- **Collision Detection**: Prevents the player from walking through walls and other obstacles.
- **Graphics Rendering**: Uses MiniLibX to render images and graphics on the screen.
- **Customizable Layout**: The game allows the user to design different levels using a map format (with walls, empty spaces, coins, and an exit).
